# ASSISTANT:
<<<domain>>>: Audio Audio Classification
<<<api_call>>>: pipeline('audio-classification', model='superb/wav2vec2-base-superb-ks')
<<<api_provider>>>: Hugging Face Transformers
<<<explanation>>>: 1. Import the necessary libraries, which are 'pipeline' from transformers and 'load_dataset' from datasets.
2. Use the 'pipeline' function from transformers to load the model, which in this case is 'superb/wav2vec2-base-superb-ks'. This model is trained for Korean speech commands, such as 'i wanna kittty'.
3. The loaded model will be used for audio classification, which is a task where the model makes a prediction for a given audio sample. In this case, the model will predict the command that was spoken in the audio sample.
4. The audio sample can be loaded from a file or acquired in real-time from a microphone or other audio input device.
<<<code>>>: from transformers import pipeline
from datasets import load_dataset
classifier = pipeline('audio-classification', model='superb/wav2vec2-base-superb-ks')
# Load the audio sample
audio_file = 'path/to/your/audio/file.wav'
# Replace 'path/to/your/audio/file.wav' with the path to your audio file
result = classifier(audio_file)
# Replace 'path/to/your/audio/file.wav' with the path to your audio file
