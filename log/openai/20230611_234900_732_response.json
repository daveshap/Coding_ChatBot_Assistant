Import the necessary libraries, which are 'pipeline' from transformers and 'load_dataset' from datasets.\n2. Use the 'pipeline' function from transformers to load the model, which in this case is 'superb/wav2vec2-base-superb-ks'. This model is trained for Korean speech commands, such as 'i wanna kittty'.\n3. The loaded model will be used for audio classification, which is a task where the model makes a prediction for a given audio sample. In this case, the model will predict the command that was spoken in the audio sample.\n4. The audio sample can be loaded from a file or acquired in real-time from a microphone or other audio input device.\n<<<code>>>: from transformers import pipeline\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\nclassifier = pipeline('audio-classification', model='superb/wav2vec2-base-superb-ks')\n# Load the audio sample\naudio_file = 'path/to/your/audio/file.wav'\n# Replace 'path/to/your/audio/file.wav' with the path to your audio file\nresult = classifier(audio_file)\n# Replace 'path/to/your/audio/file.wav' with the path to your audio file"
